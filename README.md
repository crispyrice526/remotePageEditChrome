**This chrome extension allows the controller of the JSON the extension pulls down, to inject HTML and manipulate into any chrome site the extension is enabled on.
**

** Setup: **
        1. Go to chrome://extensions
        
        2. Make sure developer mode is enabled. (Top Right Corner)
        
        3. Host a file that allows you to grab the instructions and add the url to `content.js`. 
        This can be as simple as creating a .json file on github.
        Simple set the variable `jsonFileUrl` on line one to your URL.
        
        4. Click `load unpacked` and select the downloaded folder. (Top Left Corner)
